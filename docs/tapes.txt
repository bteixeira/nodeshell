TAPE

It's not a Stream because it:
    - allows going back and forth through the items in a repeatable way
    - explicitly supports any kind of data items and not just strings
    - allows marking positions for later reference and obtaining sub sections of the tape

I would like to use tapes to traverse:
    - Strings
    - Arrays
    - Streams

Interface.
You give it an object with .length and .slice and numeric arrays
You can call
    next()
    prev()
    peek()
    hasMore()
    setMark()
    pushMark()
    popMark()
    pos
    getMarked()
    skip(filter function or regex)
