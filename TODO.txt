ROADMAP
=======
1. Basic Autocomplete
2. Allow redefining the prompt through API
3. Allow running user script on startup
4. Remaining exceptions -> Always a stack trace on exit due to file close. Do some heavy testing and try to find more.
5. Clean and put more tests in place. Create a stable release.

W. Aliases (this might need the Commands rewrite...)
X. Tokenizer. Must deliver sequence of tokens and not AST directly. Must detect unfinished tokens (needed for multi-line
    and proper autocomplete). Must consider paths and that it is possible to run an executable on this or another
    directory.
Y. Multi-line input
Z. Autocomplete overhaul

EXCEPTIONS
==========

* On CTRL+C or CTRL+D
* On cd to nonexistent dir

IDEA HEAP
=========

Piping output
	ls | function wc(list) {console.log(list.length);}

There must be a way to pipe the output of a command into a variable, or even to get it inline

I want to have a status line with completions and such. One way to achieve this would be to have virtual windows on the
    screen, have (rectangular) areas with different content and assign the line reader to one of them.

I want completion as user is typing. Show list of possible commands like I3 does. Do the same for possible completions
    of everything else.

I want on-the-fly highlighting. Show the command and arguments in different colors. Highlight Javascript.

If the prompt is a function and not a string like in other shells, that's really nice because it's powerful but if that
    is a blocking or never-ending function then everything crumbles down.

Make Javascript be the means to something and not a dictator. CoffeeScript and such should be easy to integrate. There
    should be examples and/or plugins to show how to be able to use CoffeeScript as the main language.

There will be some performance concerns. There is lots of as-you-type parsing. Try this out on a RaspberryPi and do some
    performance tests, see how many times per second it can parse a complex multi-line input.


Architecture
============

Input
    gets keystrokes, there is a mapping of key to functionality

Parser
    the functionality to accept the command (enter key) instructs to pass the current line(s) to the parser
    The parser extracts a command plus arguments, or runs JS

Environment
    There must be an API with access to:
        all the commands as functions (and everything that is in the path)
        all the nodejs globals, including process, buffer, require, etc
        a set of objects that allow overriding behaviour and attaching event handlers; even the parser should be
        available in this way. Make it such that you can override or extend parts of the parsing, or all of it together
        (dangerous, but let's think about it later)

Builtins
    cd
    'source'
        (could be a command or something like '.' ?) (or 'require' ^^)
    alias
        for compat
    bg, fg, jobs
        let's think about it later
    exit
    mkdir ?
        isn't this in the path?
    print/echo
        compat?
    kill
        useful, might be the first thing you remember in an emergency
    read?
        useful?
    umask?
    whish?
    where?
    help?
        never hurts

Should we include most of the built ins from bash and zsh to allow maximum compat? should there be some compatibility
mode that emulated them? this could probably be achieved easily.
