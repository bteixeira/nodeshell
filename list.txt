All builtins and syntax that must be supported by shell syntax
==============================================================

General command calling with arguments (getDir is a JS function)
	cd getDir()

Piping output
	ls | function wc(list) {console.log(list.length);}

Calling already existent commands
	git stash pop


Challenges
==========

The challenge is always to efficiently determine where arguments end
	git function () {return "merge";  } ( ) features/blablabla
	

What should this do?
	$ ls = 300
	$ ls
	
	Should it list directories or print the value of ls?
	A: let's let the command always have precedence, user can e.g. console.log(ls)
	or something else. otherwise user would be able to ofuscate basic commands
	very easily and bring the shell to an unusable state

What happens when there is a command called "3"?
A: again, let's assume it's a command. I have never seen commands with number as
name but if there is one, we want to be able to run it.

"Can your shell show man pages?"
