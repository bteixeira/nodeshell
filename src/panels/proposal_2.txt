Writer

    Aware of its own content. Functions as a buffer and an output stream at the same time.
    Keeps track of both the whole content and the cursor position. Therefore, the whole layout can be refreshed and
    expanded dynamically without external code to redraw the text.

    It should maybe have two writing modes: one which overwrites text at the cursor, and one which inserts it (in case
    the cursor is not at the end).

    This implementation would render the LineReader mostly useless, with most of its logic being moved inside of Writer.
    LineReader would only keep track of the inserted text and cursor position (both duplicated from Writer) in order to
    know when the cursor was at the prompt (and therefore could not move back anymore).

    Interface:

        moveCursor(dx) // cursor only moves in one dimension
        cursorTo(x)
        .columns
        .rows
        write(buf)
        clearScreenDown()
        clearScreen()
        clearLine()
        clearLineLeft()
        clearLineRight()

        setFooter(footer)
        activate()
        getOffset()
        getHeight() // same as .columns?
        setParent(parent)
        calculateWidth() // calculates the value of .columns
        isFooter()
