nodeshell
=========

What do you do when you get tired of your shell?
That's right, you make your own.

This project was born out of some disappointment with the customization possibilities of nowadays shells.
Shells like Bash and Zshell work quite well and are armed with a bunch of features, but they are really hard to customize if you're not up for reading epic size documentation and learn all the quirks and corner cases of weird mini-languages created haphazardly for a single purpose.
<!--After reading the whole User Guide on Zsh, I still felt like I didn't really know how to start making my own customization if I wasn't willing to just accept what Oh-My-Zsh provides out of the box.-->

<!--What I want is a shell that I can customize using a single imperative language instead of learning a handful of declarative langlets and three different languages for regular expression.
I want a shell that lets me evaluate normal expressions in my favorite language while still accepting known commands like "cd .."
I want a shell that exposes an API in Javascript and then just lets me do whatever I want. If the user already knows Javascript, they already know how to customize the shell.-->

<!--...and as far as I know, there isn't such a thing.

So I guess it's up to me.-->

<!--We'll start simple and just have a command line that takes usual commands as well as inline JS.
Then we'll go crazy.-->
